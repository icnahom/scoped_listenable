## Getting started

Add `scoped_listenable` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

## Usage

Provide a Listenable to descendant widgets. 

```dart
ScopedListenable(
  listenable: counterModel,
  child: MyApp(),
);
```

Observe changes in the Listenable provided by an ancestor widget.

```dart
ScopedBuilder<CounterModel>(
  builder: (context, listenable, child) {
    return Text('${listenable.counter}');
  },
);
```

### Advanced

To add multiple ScopedListenables, use ScopedContainer. 

```dart
ScopedContainer(
  container: [
    ScopedListenable.from(counterModel),
    ScopedListenable.from(settingsModel),
  ],
  child: MyApp(),
);
```

To obtain Listenable directly, use extension methods. 

```dart
void initState() {
  context.get<CounterModel>().reset();
```
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final counterModel = context.watch<CounterModel>();
```
